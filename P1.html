        <h1>How Advanced Technology has changed the Australian family.</h1>
        <p>
            Entertainment has affected the Australian household in many ways including having a TV to watch while eating
            dinner and the Walkman which provided music that was easily portable and usable. These are just a couple of
            the many ways entertainment has changed how families have acted and changed since the 1900â€™s.
<br><br>
            Since 1900 communication has made extreme advancements, letters have gone to texts, phone boxes have gone to
            smartphones and newspapers were replaced by digital news. Communication has advanced for the better and the
            worse. It has changed for the better in that people can contact each other and for the worse in that people
            are being cyberbullied.
<br><br>
            There were no fridges, no dishwashers, no laundry, no cars, and everything had to be done by hand. There was
            no television which meant that children had to find other things to do like board games. Limited appliances
            means that people had to do hard labour to get things done. People had no mobile phones which meant they
            spent more time together and wrote letters. Post WW2 there were much more appliances such as vacuum
            cleaners, toasters, and washing machines. Which meant more time for their things and their pretences
<br><br>
            of the positive impacts of technology evolving are that if anyone is in trouble, they could just call
            someone they know, and they would have more things to do like watching TV technology also made things a lot
            easier like mowing the lawn.
<br><br>
            Some of the negatives are that people have less social ability and people's eyes are always glued to the
            screen which also means less time with family and friends. There are many ways technology has influenced the
            Aussie family, both positively and negatively.
