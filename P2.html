        <h1>The Stolen Generation and White Australia Policy</h1>
        <p>The stolen generation was a generation of aboriginal children that were stolen from their homes and taken
            from their families. They were taken to orphanages and forced to become “British” This generation of
            Aboriginal children may have never seen their parents again. The White Australia policy was a policy that
            stopped the immigration of non-British people. It was named the 'white' Australia because it was created to
            keep out 'black' people. It has now changed as now Aborigines have special language institutes and now
            receive more respect. Australia has opened their borders to Asians, Indigenous Peoples, and everyone!
            Australia is a diverse, multicultural country nowadays!</p>
